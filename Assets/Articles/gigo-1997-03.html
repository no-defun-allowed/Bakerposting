<p>Why do good researchers/mathematicians/professors /students sometimes
write bad programs?  Why is it that mathematicians, for whom
simplicity and elegance of presentation and proof is supreme, often
consider representations of algorithms in the form of programs as a
necessary evil, and don't consider their presentation to be worthy of
elegance?

<p>We might expect engineers to be less interested in the readability and
elegance of their computer code than mathematicians, but we would be
wrong.  We might expect mathematicians will be more concerned with
correctness of the overall algorithm and moderate efficiency, while
engineers will be more concerned with `bit-twiddling,' but instead we
find outstanding mathematicians like Knuth teaching EboMIX.

<p>I can only conjecture about the reasons for this state of affairs.
The most innovative mathematicians seem happy when a new result is
satisfactorily proved, and leave it to lesser lights to `clean up' and
simplify the proof for future generations.  Such tasks merely `make
the obvious trivial,' and are not worthy of serious thought.

<p>People of extremely high intelligence may have larger short-term
memories, enabling them to easily juggle larger numbers of concepts
simultaneously, and may therefore see no need to simplify these
concepts for the merely mortal.

<p>Researchers are usually in the position of <cite>writing</cite> code, rather
than <cite>reading</cite> it, and therefore may not appreciate the problems
of reading another's creation.

<p>Professors often come from an earlier school before significant
thought had gone into the problem of writing readable and
understandable code.  Too early an exposure to the <code>BASIC</code>
language or to `machine language' can cause irreversable brain damage.
Sufferers are constantly fighting the `ghosts' of dead machines and
compilers; their programs show thick accents from the `old country' of
dead computer languages.

<p>Theory of computation people have trouble `step-counting' any language
other than `machine language,' even though Turing himself was fond of
the lambda calculus.

<p>Editors and reviewers must also share in the blame for bad programs
that appear in published books and articles.

<p>Perhaps those of us who care about quality programs have not spoken up
often enough--`for bad programs to triumph requires only that good
programmers remain silent.'  I call this passivity the `Silence of the
Lambdas.'

<p>We have found to our horror that computer programs live on for
decades, long after the machines and compilers that caused their
misshape have died.  We thus live in the purgatory created by our
hackerish enthusiasm.

<p>But the tight feedback mechanism between hardware/compiler
optimizations and the software `literature' ensures that the poor
programming styles of the past will persist (because they are
`efficient' on machines optimized for these poor programming styles)
and will leave little room for optimizing better styles.

<p>We must <cite>force</cite> ourselves to break out of this cycle by writing
excellent programs, and then molding compilers and machines to make
these programs efficient, rather than vice versa.  Excellent programs
do not happen by accident, but require very hard work.  We must
proactively seek elegance, as elegance will not find us on its own.

<p>What makes a bad program?  Typically, it is substantially longer than
it needs to be, so that its sheer physical size alone becomes
intimidating.  Corollaries include an explosion of irrelevant and
non-mnemonic names, and a rat's nest of boolean alternatives.

<p><strong>Definition</strong>

<blockquote>
<cite>A</cite> <strong>bad</strong> <cite>program is one whose programming style is so poor that its
opacity forces the reader to rewrite it from scratch, rather than
going to the trouble to understand it and/or debug
it.</cite>  (Comments are useful adjuncts to a well-written program,
but if they are <cite>required</cite> to understand the program, then it is
often a bad program (or a bad programming language).)
</blockquote>

<p>Let's look at a few code examples (We only have space here to
discuss `small' examples, inviting a `programming-in-the-small'
criticism; most of my comments apply also to
`programming-in-the-large') from published books of excellent
authors.  I have the highest respect for these authors, which is why
it pains me so much to see their bad programs as `inspiration' to
another generation of computer scientists.

<code><pre>
FUNCTION Euclid(a,b : INTEGER) : INTEGER;
{Computes GCD(a,b) with Euclid's algorithm}
VAR m,n,r : INTEGER;
BEGIN m:=a; n:=b;
  WHILE n &lt;&gt; 0 DO BEGIN r:=m MOD n; m:=n; n:=r END;
  Euclid:=m
END {Euclid};
</pre></code>

<p>Figure 1: Riesel's <code>Euclid</code> program (from [Riesel85], p. 242).<p>

<p>Hans Riesel, a pioneer in the use of computers for number theoretic
tasks, has an excellent book "Prime Numbers and Computer Methods for
Factorization," [Riesel85/94] now in its second edition.  Figure 1 is
his program <code>Euclid</code> for Euclid's greatest common divisor
("gcd") algorithm.

<p>I would give Riesel's <code>Euclid</code> program a grade of "B", because
while it is not a truly bad program, it certainly isn't nearly as
perspicuous as it should be for such a simple algorithm.  Riesel takes
a recursive algorithm and casts it into an `iterative' form.  To his
credit, he makes use of the "structured" capabilities of Pascal for
expressing this iteration.  However, what could be more transparent
than Wirth's elegant <code>gcd</code>
from [Jensen74], in Figure 2?
(I have inserted <code>abs()</code>
appropriately to produce a non-negative answer; unfortunately,
Wirth's later `extended' <code>GCD</code> program in the same book--p.
157--is extraordinarily ugly.)

<code><pre>
FUNCTION gcd(m,n : INTEGER) : INTEGER;
  BEGIN
    IF n=0 THEN gcd:=abs(m)
           ELSE gcd:=gcd(n,m MOD n)
  END;
</pre></code>

<p>Figure 2: Wirth's <code>gcd</code> program (from [Jensen74], p. 82).<p>

<p>Wirth's <code>gcd</code> program is smaller, uses fewer names, and
is easier to understand because it is virtually identical to the list
of mathematical rules for computing the gcd function.  It doesn't
clutter up the external namespace with extra names, and for `infinite
precision' integers (`bignums'), any minimal overhead for the
`recursion' itself will be swamped by the cost of computing bignum
<code>MOD</code>.  If it weren't for Pascal's silly syntax for
returning values, it might also be moderately readable!  (Although it
is possible to write both good and bad programs in any sufficiently
powerful language, I do <cite>not</cite> claim that the choice of
programming language is irrelevant; for example, Pascal's clumsy
syntax, poor operator precedence, and defective definitions of
arithmetic primitives make its programs needlessly hard to read and
optimize.)

<p>The usual whiners will complain that `recursion is less efficient than
iteration,' because it requires (among other things) the
stacking/unstacking of <code>O(log(max(|m|,|n|)))</code> stack frames.  But
since this gcd algorithm is <cite>tail-recursive</cite>--meaning that the
value of the recursively-called subroutine is returned as the value of
the routine itself--<cite>no stack frames need to be stacked</cite>, and
this program <strong>is</strong> iterative.  Compilers which can't compile this
loop iteratively are <cite>broken</cite>.

<p>Figure 3 is another particularly bad example of a
function <code>Jacobi</code> from Riesel's book which computes the `Jacobi
symbol' function <code>(m/p)</code>, which tries to tell us when a number
<code>m</code> is a quadratic residue modulo an odd prime <code>p</code>.  This function is
used in the inner loop of a common `probabilistic' primality
test.  (The Jacobi symbol function is discussed in exercise
4.5.4#23a of [Knuth81].)

<code><pre>
FUNCTION Jacobi(d,n : INTEGER) : INTEGER;
{Computes Jacobi's symbol (d/n) for odd n}
LABEL 1,2,3,4;
VAR d1,n1,i2,m,n8,u,z,u4 : INTEGER;
BEGIN
  d1:=d; n1:=abs(n); m:=0; n8:=n1 MOD 8;
  IF odd(n8+1) THEN
    BEGIN writeln(tty,'n even in (d/n) is not allowed');
      GOTO 3 END;
  IF d1&lt;0 THEN
    BEGIN d1:=-d1; IF (n8=3) OR (n8=7) THEN m:=m+1 END;
1: IF d1=0 THEN
    BEGIN writeln(tty,'GCD(d,n)>1 in (d/n) not allowed');
      GOTO 3 END;
  i2:=0;
2: u:=d1 DIV 2; IF d1=u*2 THEN
    BEGIN i2:=i2+1; d1:=u; GOTO 2 END;
  IF odd(i2) THEN m:=m+(n8*n8-1) DIV 8;
  u4:=d1 MOD 4; m:=m+(n8-1)*(u4-1) DIV 4; z:=n1 MOD d1;
  n1:=d1; d1:=z; n8:=n1 MOD 8; IF n1&gt;1 THEN GOTO 1;
  m:=m MOD 2; IF m=0 THEN Jacobi:=1 ELSE Jacobi:=-1;
  GOTO 4;
3: Jacobi:=0;
4: END {Jacobi};
</pre></code>

<p>Figure 3: Riesel's <code>Jacobi</code> program (from [Riesel85], p. 286).<p>

<p>This ugly <code>Jacobi</code> program is perhaps 13 years old (these
two examples both appear unchanged in the (1994) edition of Riesel's
book), but even when it was written, Dijkstra's famous "Go To
Statement Considered Harmful" paper [Dijkstra68] was already <cite>16
years old</cite>.  If this program were submitted as homework in a
programming course today, I would hope that it would get a very low
grade.

<p>Why does this <code>Jacobi</code> example cause me such anguish?

<p>1.  This example is from an extraordinarily bright person with an
excellent education (a computer pioneer) and outstanding mathematical
skills (a co-author with Erdos).

<p>2.  It shows that even <cite>16 years</cite> of well-funded screaming by the
best and brightest of computer scientists has had <cite>zero</cite> impact on
the programming styles of those outside the narrow scope of `computer
science'.  One may thus hire students that know programming <cite>or</cite>
math, but rarely both.

<p>3.  There is no evidence that programming styles being used or taught
today (1997) are any better (browse the computer shelf of any Barnes
&amp; Noble, or worse, the `examples' given in Microsoft Press books).

<p>Although Riesel's <code>Jacobi</code> program's most obvious fault is its
complete ignorance of looping constructs--one of the major reasons
for Pascal's existence!--it cannot be easily repaired with <code>WHILE</code>'s and <code>REPEAT</code>'s.

<p>Rather than attempt to fix Riesel's wirth-less program by incremental
improvements, let us rather derive a program directly from the rules
for the Jacobi symbol [Riesel85/94] [Knuth81].

<code><pre>
(0/n) = 0, except (0/1) = 1

(1/n) = 1

            (n^2-1)/8
(2/n) = (-1)

(ab/n) = (a/n)(b/n)

(m/n) = ((m mod n)/n)

            (m-1)(n-1)/4
(m/n) = (-1)             (n/m),   (m,n odd)
</pre></code>

<p>The plan of the computation for <code>(m/n)</code> is straight-forward:
recognize the boundary conditions and produce correct answers for
them, otherwise use recursion to reduce the complexity of the
parameters.

<code><pre>
FUNCTION Jacobi(m,n : INTEGER) : INTEGER;
{Computes Jacobi's symbol (m/n) for m&gt;=0, odd n&gt;0.}
  BEGIN
    IF n=0 THEN Jacobi:=1
    ELSE IF m=0 THEN Jacobi:=0
    ELSE IF odd(m) THEN
           IF (m MOD 4=3) AND (n MOD 4=3)
           THEN Jacobi:=-Jacobi(n MOD m,m)
           ELSE Jacobi:= Jacobi(n MOD m,m)
    ELSE IF (n MOD 8=3) OR (n MOD 8=5)   {Compiler does CSE, right?}
         THEN Jacobi:=-Jacobi(m DIV 2,n)
         ELSE Jacobi:= Jacobi(m DIV 2,n)
  END {Jacobi};
</pre></code>

<p>Figure 4: New, improved <code>Jacobi</code> program.<p>

<p>The program in Figure 4 is straight-forward and works
very well (we ignore <code>m<0</code>, since a non-recursive
driver can trivially map this case to <code>m>=0</code> using the
5th rule above), since it incorporates most of the optimizations
suggested by Riesel--e.g., only the low-order few bits of <code>m</code>,
<code>n</code> contribute to the decision regarding the sign of the result.
The program is <cite>not</cite> "tail-recursive", though, because it waits
until the recursive calls return before inverting them.

<p>It is a pity that computing Jacobi's symbol requires essentially the
same steps as computing the gcd, but the standard Jacobi computation
throws away the gcd information.  We are thus led to a `<code>Jcd</code>'
algorithm (Figure 5) that produces <code>(m/n)</code> when
<code>gcd(m,n)=1</code> and <code>+-gcd(m,n)</code> otherwise.  <code>Jcd(m,n)</code> costs no
more to compute than <code>Jacobi(m,n)</code>, and the Jacobi information can
be trivially recovered from the <code>Jcd(m,n)</code> result.

<code><pre>
FUNCTION Jcd(m,n : INTEGER) : INTEGER; {m&gt;=0, odd n&gt;0.}
  BEGIN
    IF m=0 THEN Jcd:=n
    ELSE IF odd(m) THEN
           IF (m MOD 4=3) AND (n MOD 4=3)
           THEN Jcd:=-Jcd(n MOD m,m)
           ELSE Jcd:= Jcd(n MOD m,m)
    ELSE IF (n MOD 8=3) OR (n MOD 8=5)
         THEN Jcd:=-Jcd(m DIV 2,n)
         ELSE Jcd:= Jcd(m DIV 2,n)
  END {Jcd};
FUNCTION Jacobi(m,n : INTEGER) : INTEGER; {odd n&gt;0.}
  BEGIN Jacobi:=1 DIV Jcd(n+(m MOD n),n) END;
</pre></code>

<p>Figure 5: Program to simultaneously compute gcd and Jacobi.<p>

<p>Now by mirroring the code, we can trivially make a tail-recursive <code>Jcd</code> which keeps the sign of the result "in the program counter"
(Figure 6).  A good compiler will allocate only one
stack frame for this function, and all of the state will be kept in
the registers and the program counter.  We can thus achieve
transparency and efficiency in the same program.

<code><pre>
FUNCTION Jcd(m,n : INTEGER) : INTEGER; {m&gt;=0, odd n&gt;0.}
  FUNCTION negJcd(m,n : INTEGER) : INTEGER; {m&gt;=0, odd n&gt;0.}
    BEGIN
      IF m=0 THEN negJcd:=-n
      ELSE IF odd(m) THEN
             IF (m MOD 4=3) AND (n MOD 4=3)
             THEN negJcd:=   Jcd(n MOD m,m)
             ELSE negJcd:=negJcd(n MOD m,m)
      ELSE IF (n MOD 8=3) OR (n MOD 8=5)
           THEN negJcd:=   Jcd(m DIV 2,n)
           ELSE negJcd:=negJcd(m DIV 2,n)
    END {negJcd};
  BEGIN
    IF m=0 THEN Jcd:=n
    ELSE IF odd(m) THEN
           IF (m MOD 4=3) AND (n MOD 4=3)
           THEN Jcd:=negJcd(n MOD m,m)
           ELSE Jcd:=   Jcd(n MOD m,m)
    ELSE IF (n MOD 8=3) OR (n MOD 8=5)
         THEN Jcd:=negJcd(m DIV 2,n)
         ELSE Jcd:=   Jcd(m DIV 2,n)
  END {Jcd};
</pre></code>

<p>Since more efficient gcd and Jacobi algorithms are known [Meyer96],
this note is not intended to be the last word on Jacobi algorithms,
but an inspiration for how to think about clear and elegant
programming.
